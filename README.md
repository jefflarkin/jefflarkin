# About Me
I am a software architect at [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/) where I run a team responsible for HPC programming models and standards. I am a long-time contributor and now technical chair for [OpenACC](https://www.openacc.org/), a directive-based parallel programming model. I have also contributed to other programming models, include OpenMP and Fortran. I have been developing code since I was a kid and have developed in many different programming languages. I am passionate about making parallel programming simpler and more productive. I have worked in the field of High Performance Computing (HPC) since 2005 (plus some years as a student even earlier) and Accelerated Computing since roughly 2010.
